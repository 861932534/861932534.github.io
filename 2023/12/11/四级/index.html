<p>第一段：it is not difficult&#x2F;hard to the point of impossibility to understand the importance of 主题，which is the vital element to modern study and life，especially the people who really intend do improve themselves.<br>第二段：1.there are several factors to explain why we have to pay attention to the topic.2.First，under the virtual economic situation，we come to realize that it causes the biggest influence on promotion of individual and the general public公众 and always produces positive effect for economy.3.second，from the students’ perspective，only when we face a variety of challenges，could we know that its existence is really  significant for us to deal with any issues which obviously is the best approach.<br>第三段：to be brief，we must maintain 主题 and are convinced that we could take it into practice，though we might have many changes in the future. As a result，we bring our dream into the promising prospect</p>
<p>（一）对网课的看法<br>　　参考范文：<br>　　Online learning has become an option because it provides flexible learning opportunities. This method has ensured that students do not get left behind on their academic study, however, some problems have also emerged during the course.<br>　　Since online learning lacks interaction compared with face-to-face teaching, it requires more attention and concentration. Sometimes, students find it so demanding to keep concentrated, and finally turn to some irrelevant online resources instead of academic study. To make sure that they stay tuned, some monitoring software can be ordered to download to ensure they are not browsing other websites while taking online courses. The increasing time students spending in digital devices also pose problems to their health. Thus, schools should encourage their students to do regular exercises such as stretches and eye massages during the break, and some guiding handbooks can be a good start.<br>　　The advance of technology should not come with the cost of loosing its original purpose, so does remote study. So we should do our utmost in doing away its possible detriments to the young.<br>　　（二）人际关系<br>　　参考范文：<br>　　Friendship is an indispensable thing in our lives. On our long journey of life, we will encounter various people and make various friends. We should learn how to maintain good friendships with friends or classmates and experience the benefits that friendship brings to us.<br>　　In daily life, we can demonstrate the good character of being helpful when our friends or classmates encounter difficulties, and comfort them when they are feeling down. This is beneficial for maintaining friendship between both parties.<br>　　Having good friendships and getting along well and harmoniously with friends can help us achieve success in our studies. When encountering difficulties in learning, we can not only seek the help of teachers, but also seek the help of friends and classmates. Their answers are also the key to our success in learning. In addition, when encountering difficulties in life that you cannot solve, attentive and enthusiastic friends will also bring warmth to you, which will be something worth remembering for a lifetime.<br>　　In short, friendship is an essential thing in our lives, and with it, our path of life can be smoother.<br>　　（三）社区服务<br>　　参考范文：<br>　　Nowadays community service has been placed more importance in our society. As aging society and empty-nest elderly has been proliferating in the entire society, it calls for<br>　　community service to assist in tending to the elderly and pre-school children.<br>　　To ensure high-quality community service,relevant administration should take the lead in<br>　　putting forward regulations and order to promote a cooperating environment, so that the<br>　　community staff can better carry out their work, or engage more people to join their cause, for example, organizing voluntary team to help with caring for the elderly residents and pre-school children in the community. In this way, the community as a whole can enjoy a more<br>　　harmonious and secured rapport, which serves as the basis of any possible development.<br>　　Taking into account what has been mentioned, concerted efforts in the whole society are needed to promote the community’s ability to enhance their service.</p>
